Whithin this project, we are using different modalities of genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 screens to identify novel mono- and combination therapies efficacious in Sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma.

This repository is an addition to our publication "Genome-wide CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screens identify DNMT1 as a druggable dependency in sonic hedgehog medulloblastoma", and includes all major code for CRISPR-Cas9 screening, DNA methylation analyses, and global transcriptional profiling.

Associated raw data can be retrieved from the repository identifiers in our publication.
